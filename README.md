This is the styles for my protopas for an Material Components Web Data Table component.
Dont use this in in production as it might get modified.

An example of how the data table looks like is available here: https://ifaxity.github.io/#/mdc-data-table

To use this within node you can install using your package manager:

yarn add mdc-data-table

or if you dont use yarn

npm install --save mdc-data-table

And then include the mdc-data-table.scss file in your scss file.

or just fork this and modify the code to your liking.
